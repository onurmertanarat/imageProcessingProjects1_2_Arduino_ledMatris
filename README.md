<h1>Image Processing Projects - Arduino LED Matrix</h1>

<h2>About the Project</h2>

<p>
    This project is a simple Arduino program to control an LED matrix on Arduino. It was developed as a final project
    assignment for the "Image Processing" course.
</p>

<h2>Project Details</h2>

<p>
    This Arduino program allows you to control an LED matrix using serial communication. Each digit sent via serial
    corresponds to a specific LED in the matrix. For example, sending '1' turns on the first LED, '2' turns on the
    second LED, and so on.
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>
    To use this program, upload the code to your Arduino board and connect the LED matrix according to the pin
    configuration specified in the code. Then, open the serial monitor and send digits ('1' through '9') to control the
    LEDs.
